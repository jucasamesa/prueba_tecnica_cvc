# Image Classification App

This project is an image classification application built using [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) or [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). The goal of this application is to classify images based on the provided dataset.

## Data

- **Raw Data**: The original training data is located in `data/raw/training_data.csv`. This file contains the unprocessed data that will be used for training the model.
- **Processed Data**: The preprocessed data, which is cleaned and transformed for model training, can be found in `data/processed/preprocessed_data.csv`.

## Notebooks

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: The Jupyter notebook `notebooks/exploratory.ipynb` is used for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to visualize and understand the dataset.

## Source Code

- **Data Preprocessing**: The `src/data/preprocess.py` script contains functions for loading, cleaning, and transforming the raw data.
- **Dataset Class**: The `src/data/dataset.py` script defines a custom dataset class for loading and batching data during training.
- **Model Architecture**: The `src/models/model.py` script defines the architecture of the image classification model.
- **Training Loop**: The `src/models/train.py` script contains the training loop, including optimization and loss calculation.
- **Model Evaluation**: The `src/evaluation/evaluate.py` script evaluates the trained model and calculates metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
- **Utility Functions**: The `src/utils/helpers.py` script includes various utility functions for logging, visualization, and configuration management.
